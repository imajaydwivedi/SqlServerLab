1) Check domain name before request for SSL Certificate from Let's Encrypt

https://letsdebug.net/

ReservedAddress
Fatal
A private, inaccessible, IANA/IETF-reserved IP address was found for sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com. 
Let's Encrypt will always fail HTTP validation for any domain that is pointing to an address that is not routable on the internet. 
You should either remove this address and replace it with a public one or use the DNS validation method instead.

2) On Ubuntu, ensure to add firewall exception for port 80 & 443
Best is to look in Router's Port Forward Rules to figure out port redirection.
Then look into /etc/ngin/nginx.conf file

As per current ryzen9 configuration,
  #port 80/443 is configured inside apache2 also
  port 80/8080 is being used by nginx
  port 3000 is being used by sqlmonitor vm via direct bridged adapter
  port 5000/5001 is being used by sqlmonitor alert engine via nginx

Disable Apache2 if required -
---------------------------
  sudo systemctl stop apache2.service
  sudo systemctl disable apache2.service

Enable apache2 if required -
---------------------------
  sudo systemctl start apache2.service
  sudo systemctl enable apache2.service

Stop Nginx during Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate Renewal as port 80/443 are being redirected to Alert Engine
---------------------------------------
  sudo systemctl stop nginx.service
  sudo systemctl start apache2.service

3) Ensure to Add DNS A record for 'sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com' on Cloudflare.com

4) Ensure ajaydwivedi.ddns.net is still active, and ddns update on Airtel router is working

5) Use following powershell code inside a cron job to update IP for 'sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com' dynamically

https://github.com/imajaydwivedi/SqlServerLab/blob/dev/Other-Scripts/cloudflare-ddns-update-Python.py

Help -> https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/dns-records-for-a-zone-patch-dns-record

6) Ensure that 
  a) http://sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com:3000 is active (grafana dashboard)
  b) http://sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com is active (apache server on desktop)

7) Use following document to download SSL certificate using LetsEncrypt & Cloudflare combination on Ubuntu
https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal&tab=wildcard

create file ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini with following API Token 
dns_cloudflare_api_token = your-api-token-here

sudo certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/certbot/cloudflare.ini \
  -d sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com \
  -d www.sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com


Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/privkey.pem

# validate details
sudo ls -lrt /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/
sudo ls -ltr /stale-storage/share-stalestorage/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/

# Test automatic renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 30

8) Copy the saved certificates to shared patch
sudo chmod a+r /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/fullchain.pem
sudo chmod a+r /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/privkey.pem

sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/fullchain.pem /stale-storage/share-stalestorage/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/fullchain.pem
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/privkey.pem /stale-storage/share-stalestorage/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/privkey.pem

sudo chmod +777 /stale-storage/share-stalestorage/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/fullchain.pem
sudo chmod +777 /stale-storage/share-stalestorage/sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com/privkey.pem

9) For SSL Certificate required for IIS, merge OpenSSL Certificate & Key (Optional)
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey privkey.pem -in fullchain.pem

10) Copy the certificates to path C:\sqlmonitor.ajaydwivedi.com

11) Restart grafana

12) Deploy SSL certificate for apache2 on Ubuntu
