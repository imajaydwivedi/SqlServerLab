To completely remove Anaconda (conda) from your Ubuntu system, follow these steps:

1. Deactivate any active conda environment
If you are currently in any conda environment, deactivate it first:

bash
Copy code
conda deactivate
2. Uninstall Anaconda using conda
If you installed Anaconda via conda, you can use the following command to uninstall it:

bash
Copy code
conda install anaconda-clean
anaconda-clean --yes
The anaconda-clean command will remove configuration files, environments, and the Anaconda directory, but it will leave your personal files intact (like notebooks or other saved data).

3. Manually Remove Anaconda Directory
If anaconda-clean does not completely remove everything, you can manually delete the Anaconda directory. The default installation path is typically:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf ~/anaconda3
Or, if you installed Miniconda:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf ~/miniconda3
4. Remove conda and Anaconda-related binaries
Remove conda and related binaries from your system path:

bash
Copy code
rm -f /usr/local/bin/conda
rm -f /usr/local/bin/activate
rm -f /usr/local/bin/deactivate
Also, check the following locations for any remaining Anaconda/conda-related files and remove them if present:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf ~/.conda
rm -rf ~/.condarc
rm -rf ~/.anaconda_backup
5. Remove Anaconda from .bashrc (or .zshrc)
Anaconda typically adds a line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file to modify your PATH and set up the environment. You can remove the lines related to Anaconda by editing the file:

bash
Copy code
nano ~/.bashrc
Look for and remove the following lines (or similar ones) added by Anaconda:

bash
Copy code
# added by Anaconda3 installer
export PATH="$HOME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
Then, save the file (Ctrl + O), and exit (Ctrl + X).

Afterward, refresh your shell:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
Or, if you're using zsh:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.zshrc
6. Remove Jupyter-related files (Optional)
If you want to remove Jupyter Notebook and its configuration files, you can delete them as well:

bash
Copy code
rm -rf ~/.jupyter
rm -rf ~/.local/share/jupyter
7. Remove conda and Anaconda from system-wide paths (if applicable)
If you've installed Anaconda system-wide (for all users), remove the directories where Anaconda was installed:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm -rf /opt/anaconda
sudo rm -rf /opt/miniconda
8. Verify Removal
Finally, check that conda and Anaconda have been completely removed:

bash
Copy code
which conda
This should return no output if conda is successfully removed.
